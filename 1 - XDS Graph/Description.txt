
The file 'XDS Graph.xls' is a project I started to help me diagnose an intermittent signal problem with the XDS satellite receiver we used to receive ESPN sports programming for rebroadcast in our market. I chose to develop the idea in Excel VBA because it was fast & easy, and I did not have access to Visual Studio.

The XDS is a commercial radio satellite receiver designed on an embedded Linux platform. It has various servers, such as HTTP, FTP, and NTP, and built-in web-based configuration pages, much like a consumer-grade home router from Netgear or Linksys. It also has a primitive error logging system, but it's difficult to read and only stores basic parameters.

We began having problems with intermittent satellite signals that were causing loss of audio on the air. I tried to make do troubleshooting with the built-in error log, but it just wasn't useful enough. So I got an idea. I went one better and made my own troubleshooting tool, and 'XDS Graph' is the result.

XDS-Graph is an Excel VBA spreadsheet of medium complexity, and is esssentially a web data-mining tool that's coded for a spefific piece of hardware. The code can be found in 'Module 1' in the Visual Basic editor window of the workbook.

It does the following:
- system calls to Kernel32 for the Sleep function
- uses the HTML DOM (document object model) of the Microsoft Internet Control (aka IE)
- acesses the main configuration page of the receiver in a hidden browser window
- enters login information
- open a specific page/frame containing the data
- uses the DOM to get the decimal values of the data
- logs the data in the worksheet until the desired date & time
- there is an additional subroutine that simply lists all HTML elements on the page

The chart shown on the sheet was created manually to represent the collected data.

And it worked! The downward spikes in the graph correspond to the times of the errors. In the end, the cause was determined to be a problem in the tuner section of the reciever, and the carrier sent us a replacement reciever.
